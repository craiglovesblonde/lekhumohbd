  <p><i><b> <font face = "Arial"> Happy 19th birthdayy Lekhumo woooo, I hope today is nothing but an abundance of love and happiness. I hope you clicked the button, Lamia said I should put Shot Clock cause you love it. I wanted to try something new with the whole website idea, something that you could have never predicted yk what I mean.. so I made this your birthday card, another reason I made this was cause I know you’d lose anything I gave you in like a week or something, so this could be w you forever. I just wanted to make the whole look and execution as perfect as it could get for you.

</br></br>On top of that yk how I like going above and beyond, i just liked the idea of the challenge and it being for you was already enough for the motivation.

</br></br>Anywaysss, this whole thing was made to just tell you how I really do appreciate you wholeheartedly Lekhumo. We have seen each other evolve into different versions of ourselves over all this time, it is wild. All I can say is that I really am happy to have you in my life playing a role that I don’t think yk about, despite all the rollercoasters and differences we have had over the past 2 years, I naturally gravitate towards you… regardless of anything. You have a caring and at the same time fiery personality that I really can’t put into words, but it really is just the best thing to be around. Just someone I wouldn’t be able to stay from or let go yk, I have no explanation for it but it really is just that… maybe yk why.

</br></br>Aside from all that, I did put a couple pictures together which were soo hard to find since I cleared a lot of shit but I tried, shit that I don’t think you remember being taken or whatever, just like a memory refresher lol, you can click on them to see them properly and all,

</br></br>Regarding your gift, I am not gonna say what I got for you exactly cause I haven’t made my mind up on when I’ll send you this, but I got it for you cause I could just see you in it yk what I mean, I like it and I reallyyyy hope you do as well
The other gift is something I begged my sister to make cause I also saw you in that, I’ve been on her ass to finish before the 10th it’s so crazy, I hope you love them both

</br></br>I wanna DEFINITELY see how you look in everything, for reviewing purposes and for my conscience lololol

</br></br>Shot Clock should be done playing so I put another song here that you can listen to, a song I love from your favourite artist lol, just click on the button below this and yeah

<div class="celebrate-container">
        <button id="btnSong2">SONG #2 </button>
    </div>
</br></br><p><i> <font face = "Arial">Anyways I don’t wanna write a book for you, I just haven’t done this in forever and I felt your birthday would be the perfect time to say something because I am not able to say something every single day yk

</br></br>This website will exist forever, this shit was so hard to do Lekhumo like fuck

</br></br>But I can make anything possible for you and with you, yk that 

</br></br>Enjoy 19 Lekhumo and God bless your beautiful soul </br></br>

--- Craig ❤️</i></p>
