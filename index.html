	<p><i> Happy birthdayyyy Lekhumoooo wooo, I hope ya 19th been full of nothing but love and happiness. I wanted to try something new with this one, cause ik if I gave you something physical, you'd just lose it in like a week or some shit lol. This one is forevaa. </br>
<br/> This was sooo hard to make like fuck but I feel I needed to do something so unpredictable and different from what you could be used to, I actually really hope you like it, and yk me and liking a challenge and whatever. This message is just to tell you that I really do appreciate you as a person Lekhumo, we have seen each other become different people over so much time it is so crazy.
<br/>But I can easily say I am really happy to have you present in my life, despite all the rollercoasters we have been on, we will always end up in the same place one way or another lol. I don't really think I can stay completely away from you, just doesn't work with me man. I don't have many pictures unfortunately cause I cleared a lot of bullshit but I dooo have stuff I don't think you remember being taken or whatever, just some memory refreshers yk what I mean.
<br/>Regardingggg your gift, I got you something that I hope you actually wear, I actually like it and it was something I could envision you in soo, hopefully I didn't fuck up, you will lmk. The otherrrr gift is something I beeennn on my sister's ass for cause I damn near begged her to make it, I knew it would be amazing for you and it just made sense to me like its so crazy, so I pressed her to finish that mf before the 10th, I hope you like it as well
<br/>I wanna see how they both look on you, reviewing purposes ofc 😜
</br>I got your jam playing, something I remember hearing you listen to lol. iwl I am straight lying, this song is all Lamia, I hope it doesn't piss you off cause this was also hard asf to make. But yk I can always make anything possible for you and with you. </br>
</br>Enjoy 19 Lekhumo and God bless your beautiful soul
</br>--- Craig ❤️	</i></p>
