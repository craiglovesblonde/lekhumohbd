  <p><i><b> <font face = "Arial"> Happy birthdayyyy Lekhumoooo wooo, I hope ya 19th been full of nothing but love and happiness. I wanted to try something new with this one, cause ik if I gave you something physical, you'd just lose it in like a week or some shit lol. This one could stay with you forevaa. </br>
<br/> This was sooo hard to make like fuck but I feel I needed to do something so unpredictable and different from what you could be used to, something that can create a new feeling for you, I actually really hope you like it, and yk me and liking a challenge and whatever. This message is just to tell you that I really do appreciate you wholeheartedly Lekhumo, we have seen each other become different versions of ourselves over so much time it is so crazy.
<br/>But I can easily say I am really happy to have you present and playing an active role in my life, despite all the rollercoasters and differences we have had over the past 2 years, something will always bring us back... regardless of anything lol. I don't really think I can stay completely away from you shem, you not someone I wanna let go of like ever, it really is just one of those things that I can't even explain... you can come up with your own conclusion from it.</br></br> Aside from all that, I put a few pictures together, unfortunately I cleared a lot of stuff but I do still have soemthingggg, shit I don't think you remember being taken or whatever, just some memory refreshers yk what I mean.</br></br>
<br/>Regardingggg your gift, I got you something that I hope you actually wear, I actually like it and it was something I could envision you in soo, hopefully I didn't fuck up, you will lmk. </br>Something that screams you when I saw it lol. The otherrrr gift is something I beeennn on my sister's ass for cause I damn near begged her to make it, I knew it would be amazing for you and it just made sense to me like its so crazy, so I pressed her to finish that mf before the 10th, I hope you like it as well
<br/></br>I wanna see how they both look on you, reviewing purposes ofc haha 😜</br>
</br>I got your lil jam playing, something I remember you fucking with lol. iwl I am straight lying, this song is all Lamia, she said it would be good to add lol.</br></br>You can click the button at the top again for Shot Clock but if you wanna hear something else, press right here. 
  
  <div class="celebrate-container">
        <button id="btnSong2">SONG #2 </button>
    </div>
 I hope it doesn't piss you off cause these were so hard to add eh.</br></br> But I can make anything possible for you and with you, you even know that.  </br>
</br>Enjoy 19 Lekhumo and God bless your beautiful soul
</br></br>--- Craig ❤️	</b></font></i></p>
